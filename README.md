The ultimate tool to wish everyone a merry Christmas.

## Purpose

This project is meant as a playground to experiment with the _most recent_ Java features.

The project itself is built with **Java 18**, and it comes with the following dependencies:

* `Apache Commons 3`
* `JUnit 5`
* `Mockito 4`
* `Apache log4j 2`

## How to set up the project

1. Install Maven (**at least 3.8.x**) and JDK 18
2. Clone the project locally and move into its folder
3. Run the command `mvn install -DskipTests`
4. Import the project inside your IDE as a Maven project
5. Ensure your IDE is correctly configured to use a Java 18 JDK.

*Note*: if your IDE is [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer), update it to the version 4.24 (2022-06) which added Java 18 support.
